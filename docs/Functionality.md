* From the options menu, select "Create" to navigate to song the creation window, which will include 
a sample browser and step sequencer, where samples can be looped, played back, and saved as an 
individual song. 

* To create a song, scroll a selection of sounds in the sample browser (located above the step sequencer)
and drag & drop desired samples into the tracks (default 4) that make up the sequencer. 

* Once a sample has been loaded into one of the 4 tracks, it can be Looped by selecting the empty
