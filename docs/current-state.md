## Current State of The Application

* This app currently includes basic navigation from an options menu (which is also the home screen )
to 3 activities which include "Create", "Listen", and "Mix". 

* The "Create" button navigates to an activity that has a sample browser and will eventually incorporate
 a step sequencer for music creation. 
 
* The "Listen" option will take the user to a playlist made up of songs created by the user. This activity
is currently empty.

* The "Mix option" will take the user to another step sequencer where the user will be able to create
mixes using entire songs instead of samples. This activity is currently empty and will be completed 
as a stretch goal.
