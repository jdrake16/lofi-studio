## Introduction & Project Description

_lofi Studio_ 1.0 is a sample based beat-maker that uses a sequencer to create lofi sounds. 
This app is for those who enjoy the calming sounds of lofi, and for those who have yet to discover it. 


 The inspiration for this app comes from my love of music production and lofi music. 
Lofi is generally associated with relaxation as well as simplicity, and this app was created with
that in mind. It can take years to learn how to properly use a Digital Audio Workstation (which is 
the tool for creating/arranging most music these days). Lofi Studio is a DAW in its simplest form 
that can be used by anyone with no previous experience in music production. It has a minimalistic 
design that doesn't clutter the screen with unnecessary functions and is aesthetically pleasing 
as is it intuitive. With lofi Studio 1.0 the process of creating lofi will be as smooth as the genre itself.
 

 The basic functionality includes creating loop-based lofi beats using a high-quality selection of 
low-fidelity sounds. Beats will be created in sequencer-type playlist where samples can be loaded, 
looped, and recorded/exported. The user will also be able to create playlists of custom beats 
for all you lofi needs.
